MVC-->model view controller
its a design pattern
Devloping Dynamic Techanologies

Advantage of Pre Defined pattern is the problem and a solution to it given mvc does that it gives a blueprint so that we no need to waste time in solving errors



Design Paterns
==============
	are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real world app-development
	patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects

23 Gang of Four Design patterns are the foundations

Types:
	1.Creational
		deal with creating of objects 
		types:
			Abstract Factory 
			Builder
			Factory Method
			Singleton
	2.Structural 
		designing of classes and relationship between classes
		Types:
			adapter
			bridge
			composite
			decorator
			facade
			flyweight
			proxy
	3.Behavioral
		object communication


Architectural Patterns:
		broder scope as compared to design patterns

wwwroot folder->contains only static files lie js,css

Model-->Represent the shape of the data a class i c# is used to describe a model data related to the project is present here it can be a table inside the sql servr

View-->is the user interface

controller-->acts as an intermediate and recives all the user requests

url syntax:->  https://localhost:port_number/controller_name/action/id(optional)

In controllers foldr we will have multiple controllers create methoods with names and these name are the action names so when that action is typed it goes to that controller
and then IActionResult returns a view which will be there in the views folder now based on the controller name there will be folder in the views folder which will ontais the .cshtml files wth the name ssame as the action methood names 
the html view file will contain the bootstrap and the html elements

there is a shared folder under the views folder this is the place where we add global JS and css/HTML codes

Tag Helpers
===========
	they enable in server sidecode to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in razor files
	focused aroung the HTML elements and are natural to use 
	
	
_Layout.cshtml
==============
	this is used for UI which will remain common fr all the pages so even when we switch between pages the UI remain the same eg:header and footer
	
 <a class="nav-link " asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>-->this is special kind of hyperlink where the url chnahes to controler/method
 
app.MapControllerRoute(
name: "default",
pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");---<this will tell which controllr and view shoukd open first
